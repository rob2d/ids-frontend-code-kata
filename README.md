# Message Dialog Kata

## Introduction

The Design team would like you to create a simple page with a button that shows a message dialog.

This message dialog should appear in the middle of the page when clicking on the `<custom-button>` that reads *Show Message*, it should
try to follow the design standards we set out.

Once the message is being displayed we'd like to offer an option to hide it.

1. Hitting `ESC` on your keyboard
2. Clicking on the closing link `X` on the top right of the pop up box

## Working Example

[Message Dialog Example](https://main-enterprise.demo.design.infor.com/components/message/example-index.html?layout=nofrills)

## Goal

Your goal is to write the necessary HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to achieve the same effect as in the example. Since we use web components in 
IDS we would like make sure that the component is created as a web component with a custom element. This is explained well at [MDM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)

The `<custom-message>` should appear when clicking on the `<custom-button>`.

Once the message is being displayed we'd like to offer an option to hide it. 

1. Hitting `ESC` on your keyboard
2. Clicking on the closing link `X` on the top right of the pop up box

## Requirements

1. Runs in Chrome only
1. Try not using any external dependencies or libraries (in our projects this is a requirement)

## What We Are looking For

1. Code Style and Decisions in HTML, Css and JS
1. Ability to do it as a web component
1. Attention to detail
1. Accessibility Considerations
