# Message Dialog Kata

## Introduction

A Kata is a Japanese word meaning “form”, and in the martial arts it describes a choreographed pattern of movements used to train yourself to the level of muscle memory. We use this Kata to check your form and style while creating a Javascript Web Component.

For this Kata imagine our Design team would like you to create a simple error dialog called a message dialog `<custom-message-dialog>`.

This message dialog should appear in the middle of the page when clicking on the `<custom-button>` that reads *Show Message*, it should try to follow the design standards and technology standards we set out.

Once the message is being displayed we'd like you to offer an option to hide it. 

1. Hitting `ESC` on your keyboard
2. Clicking on the message button

## Working Example

[Message Dialog Example](https://main-enterprise.demo.design.infor.com/components/message/example-error.html?layout=nofrills)

## Goal

Your goal is to write the necessary HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to achieve the same effect as in the example. Since we use web components in 
Infor Design we would like you to make it as a web component with a custom element. This is explained in detail at [MDM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)

The `<custom-message-dialog>` component appear when clicking on the `<custom-button>`.

Once the message is being displayed we'd like you to offer an option to hide it. 

1. Hitting `ESC` on your keyboard
2. Clicking on the message button

## Requirements

1. Runs in Chrome only
1. Try not using any external dependencies or libraries (in our projects this is a requirement)
1. The old example uses jQuery, since we are using web components now jQuery should not be used.
1. Style it as close to the old example as possible (the svg icon is in the images folder)

## What We Are looking For

1. Code Style and Decisions in HTML, Css and JS
1. Ability to do it as a web component
1. Attention to detail
1. Accessibility Considerations
